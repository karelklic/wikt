Wikt should be a collaborative project and encourage contributions.

* Coding Standards

All the code should follow the GNU Coding Standards.
If it doesn't, it must be fixed.

Ref: http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/

* Releasing a new version

Preparing source package:
./release.sh
./sync_web.sh

Preparing Debian packages:
You should add a new entry, which indicates new upstream version, 
to debian/changelog file. Use previous entries as a template. The date 
needed to add the new entry can be generated running `date -R`.

Then go to the top directory of Wikt source code and run `dpkg-buildpackage`.

Local variables:
mode: outline
end:
