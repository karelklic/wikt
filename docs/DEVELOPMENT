./release.sh
./sync_web.sh


=== Preparing Debian packages
You should add a new entry, which indicates new upstream version, 
to debian/changelog file. Use previous entries as a template. The date 
needed to add the new entry can be generated running `date -R`.

Then go to the top directory of Wikt source code and run `dpkg-buildpackage`.
