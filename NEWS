------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wikt 0.20.0 (work in progress)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * dictionary: CheckTrans sections are not displayed in entries.
  * libwikt: Support for more languages added.
  * convdict23: Bugfix in evaluating templates uc: ucfirst: lc: lcfist:,
    fixes invalid trimming of result. Affects entry [[acaeciera]].
  * convdict34: Generates form-of/gloss entries statistics.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wikt 0.19.0 (released 2009-08-24)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * Source code was heavily refactored and simplified, which results 
    in significantly smaller source code line count.
  * Some parts of Wikt application were moved to separate CLI 
    programs. Dynamic shared library libwikt was created.
  * Memory usage of dictionary processing tools was decreased. 
    Several memory leaks were discovered and removed.
  * Unit tests were moved to separate applications outside of main 
    source code.
 
 Bugfixes
  * Tags <includeonly>, <onlyinclude>, and <noinclude> are detected 
    using regular expressions instead of fixed strings, 
    eg. old <includeonly>, new: <includeonly\s*>. Affects entry "apple".
  * Template evaluation fixed: {{Template:Appendix:Contents}} text 
    appeared in the entry [[Category:Appendices]]. Now it is handled 
    as {{Appendix:Contents}} in convdict23 pass because Appendix is 
    a valid namespace.
  
 New Features
  * Support of 2009-07-11 version of Wiktionary data.
  * Application can be installed in any subdirectory (/opt, /usr, ~) of 
    user's computer.
  * User interface:
    o The lookup panel receives focus when any appropriate key is 
      pressed in the application. This means that when you write a word 
      using keyboard, the word is written to the lookup panel no matter 
      which UI control was focused.
    o Whole application is localizable. Czech localization is available.
    o Statistics language table is sortable (Javascript).
  * Library:
    o The parser is heavily optimized and major bottlenecks reported by 
      valgrind are removed.
    o Support for dictionary data files larger than 2 GB: changed 32-bit 
      signed integer file pointers to 64-bit signed integer file 
      pointers. This feature changes the dictionary format.
    o Support for more languages added.
    o Support of remaining namespaces added: Concordance(Talk), 
      CitationsTalk, Transwiki(Talk), WT(Talk).
  * Tools:
    o convdict23: Template evaluation cache results in better 
      performance.
    o convdict23: Implementation of Template:formatnum. 
      Affects [[Category:!Kung language]].

    the image on Wiktionary (external link). Affects a picture in

    table in the [[bud]] entry.

 New Features
  * External links parsed properly, and open in external browser window 
    when activated.
  * Links to wikipedia such as [[w:IPA]] are converted to external 
    links like [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/IPA IPA]. Clicking to 
    the external link opens external browser.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wikt 0.16.0 (released on 18 May 2009)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bug Fixes
  * Find buttons disabled when the edit box has no content. 
    Also "Find Next" menu item works now.
  * Subwindows are no longer blinking on application start.
  * Fixed a write order/sorting bug in Format3Writer, Format4Writer, 
    MediaWriter. It caused reading problems in media file.

    (class ListParser). Affects "catalog" entry.

    into account. It results in proper parsing of "stroke#Etymology 1".

    Fixes the parsing of "A#Translingual->Etymology 1", "dog".

 New Features
  * Images in entries are displayed.
  * Pronunciation audio in entries is played.
  * Better layout of Find dialog.
  * Added Low Saxon and Lojban to interwiki support code. All missing 
    localized interwiki language names were added.

    [[Appendix:English nouns]].

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wikt 0.15.0 (released on 13 May 2009)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the first release that allows to create the media pack with 
pronounciation audio files and images.
The media pack occupies 3.8 gigabytes.

Many parser bugs were fixed in this release, and there are many new 
user-facing changes.

Bug Fixes
  * Fixed the "stadiums" entry, where the error was caused by bad 
    interpretation of "Template:plural of", which contained a link 
    inside a link as a parameter in template call. Template argument 
    parser improperly parsed [[[[link a]] link b]].
  * Paragraph parser now detects beginning of a table and closes
    the paragraph (entry "carr#Irish").
  * Table cell parser now recognizes links with parameters on first 
    line of a cell (entry "carr#Irish", "Appendix:Variations of "a"").
  * Category processing now handles various links well. Entry "myslet" 
    does not list "Category:Czech verbs" twice. The entry contains 
    links [[Category:Czech verbs]] and [[Category: Czech verbs]].
  * Fixed parsing of lists: when a list item line is followed by a line
    that (after any number of whitespaces) contains a category link,  
    that line with category link is considered as a part of list item 
    (for example see definition list in "stadia"). This is not 
    logical, but let's follow the Way of MediaWiki.

New Features
  * New "Media Packer" tool packs all media files to a single file.
  * Optional visibility of sections such as Etymology, Translations, 
    Inflections, and Anagrams.
  * Cherokee language supported in interwiki. Added another seven 
    localized names for languages to interwiki support.
  * Copy text to clipboard, cut, paste works with Ctrl+C, Ctrl+X, 
    Ctrl+V.
  * Page search (Ctrl+F). Design took from Firefox; it's the best 
    way of text searching I know.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Features
  * Links to missing entries are removed in format4 (only the link 
    text remains).

    of hours.
  * All format conversion dialogs remember file paths between 
    application runs.
  * Status bar displays links.
  * Media downloader downloads all images and sounds used in 
    a dictionary to local filesystem.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wikt 0.13.0 (released on 2 May 2009)

not ready to be used by common users. However, many new lines of code 
were written as a pedestal for upcoming features.

  * Link node reworked to support new features (entry existence 
    checking, conversion of outgoing links to external form)
  * Entry namespaces, languages, Wikimedia projects handled 
    explicitly in code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    [[cognoscere]]. DivHtmlParser is changed to BlockHtmlParser 
    because of CENTERs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wikt 0.10.0 (released on 21 April 2009)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the initial release of source code.

The project has been started in 2008-11. The first larger iteration was 
implemented in gtkmm, but all subsequent attempts to embed Gecko or 
WebKit into GTK failed. It was simply too much work to do. At the end 
the whole library was rewritten to Qt.
