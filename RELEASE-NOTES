== Wikt 0.17.0 Release Notes ==

Wikt 0.17.0 is a development release. It is a work in progress -- definitely not suitable for end users.

=== Bug Fixes ===
* Images in thumbnail style contain icon which now links to the image on wiktionary (external link). Affects a picture in the "dog" entry for example.
* Interwiki links are extracted from whole document, also from inside paragraphs etc. Removed the "interwiki paragraph" concept. Affects all entries.
* Parsing of table headers fixed. Affects a Danish inflection table in the "bud" entry.

=== New Features ===
