== Wikt 0.16.0 Release Notes ==

Wikt 0.16.0 is a development release. It is a work in progress -- definitely not suitable for end users.

=== Bug Fixes ===
* Find buttons disabled when the edit box has no content. Also "Find Next" menu item works now.
* Subwindows are no longer blinking on application start.
* Fixed a write order/sorting bug in Format3Writer, Format4Writer, MediaWriter. It caused reading problems in media file.
* Empty list items are ignored when parsing wiki text (class ListParser). Affects "catalog" entry.
* Paragraph boundary detection takes links (characters inside links) into account. It results in proper parsing of "stroke#Etymology 1".
* Parser handles links embedded in links; this is used in images. Fixes the parsing of "A#Translingual->Etymology 1", "dog".

=== New Features ===
* Images in entries are displayed.
* Pronunciation audio in entries is played.
* Better layout of Find dialog.
* Added Low Saxon and Lojban to interwiki support code. All missing localized interwiki language names were added.
* Support of underline ("u") HTML tag, which is used in "Appendix:English nouns".
