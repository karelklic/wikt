Here is a list of known bugs and wishes.

== {{PAGESINCATEGORY}}

Template:PAGESINCATEGORY not implemented.
It is used in [[Category:!Kung language]].

== {{#ifexpr:0 or 0}}

Expression parser does not support expression "0 or 0".
It is used in [[Category:!Kung language]].

== Categories

Categories should store a list of entries pointing to them.
Theis should be done in convdict23.

== Error pages

When user enters a word to the lookup panel and the word is not found, an error page should be displayed.

== Icons

Menu bar of the application should be decorated with icons.

== <ref> and <references/>

Support for these tags must be implemented. Should be done either in convdict23 or convdict34 (preferred).

== Expr errors and nonexisting templates

convdict23 should be extended with switches to show #expr evaluation errors and to report nonexisting templates to console.


== #section template

#section template is used in Index:English/j page and elsewhere.
It must be implemented properly.
