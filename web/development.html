<h2>Notebook</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2009-07-29: <b>Wikt 0.19.0 release notes</b><br/> 
    <ul>
      <li>Source code was heavily refactored and simplified, which results in significantly smaller source code line count.</li>
      <li>Some parts of Wikt application were moved to separate CLI programs. Dynamic shared library libwikt was created.</li>
      <li>Memory usage of dictionary processing tools was decreased. Several memory leaks were discovered and removed.</li>
      <li>Unit tests were moved to separate applications outside of main source code.</li>
    </ul>
    Bugfixes
    <ul>
      <li>Tags &lt;includeonly&gt;, &lt;onlyinclude&gt;, and &lt;noinclude&gt; are detected using regular expressions instead of fixed strings, eg. old &lt;includeonly&gt;, new: &lt;includeonly\s*&gt;. Affects entry "apple".</li>
      <li>Template evaluation fixed: {{Template:Appendix:Contents}} text appeared in the entry [[Category:Appendices]]. Now it is handled as {{Appendix:Contents}} in convdict23 pass because Appendix is a valid namespace.</li>
    </ul>
    New Features
    <ul>
      <li>Support of 2009-07-11 version of Wiktionary data.</li>
      <li>Application can be installed in any subdirectory (/opt, /usr, ~) of user's computer.</li>
      <li>User interface:
	<ul>
	  <li>The lookup panel receives focus when any appropriate key is pressed in the application. This means that when you write a word using keyboard, the word is written to the lookup panel no matter which UI control was focused.</li>
	  <li>Whole application is localizable. Czech localization is available.</li>
	  <li>Statistics language table is sortable (Javascript).</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>Library:
	<ul>
	  <li>The parser is heavily optimized and major bottlenecks reported by valgrind are removed.</li>
	  <li>Support for dictionary data files larger than 2 GB: changed 32-bit signed integer file pointers to 64-bit signed integer file pointers. This feature changes the dictionary format.</li>
	  <li>Support for more languages added.</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>Tools:
	<ul>
	  <li>convdict23: template evaluation cache results in better performance</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
