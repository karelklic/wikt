h1. Development Environment

This application is written in C++ language with the use of the following tools:

* Eclipse 3.4.2
** Mylyn C++ plugin 5.0.2
** Qt C++ Eclipse Integration 1.5.1
* Qt 4.5.0
* GCC 4.3.3
* flex 2.5.35
* bison 2.3

Eclipse is not ideal environment for development. 
The code editing is very slow and the debugger does not show the contents of QString. 
When the Qt support is introduced in NetBeans, I will try it and maybe move away from Eclipse.
