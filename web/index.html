<h2>Latest News</h2>
<h3>Wikt 0.19.0 was released on 24 September 2009</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Source code was heavily refactored and simplified, which results in significantly smaller source code line count.</li>
  <li>Some parts of Wikt application were moved to separate CLI programs. Dynamic shared library libwikt was created.</li>
  <li>Memory usage of dictionary processing tools was decreased. Several memory leaks were discovered and removed.</li>
  <li>Unit tests were moved to separate applications outside of main source code.</li>
</ul>
Bugfixes
<ul>
  <li>Tags &lt;includeonly&gt;, &lt;onlyinclude&gt;, and &lt;noinclude&gt; are detected using regular expressions instead of fixed strings, eg. old &lt;includeonly&gt;, new: &lt;includeonly\s*&gt;. Affects entry "apple".</li>
  <li>Template evaluation fixed: {{Template:Appendix:Contents}} text appeared in the entry [[Category:Appendices]]. Now it is handled as {{Appendix:Contents}} in convdict23 pass because Appendix is a valid namespace.</li>
</ul>
