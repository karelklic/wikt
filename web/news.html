<h2>Wikt 0.15.0 was released on 13 May 2009</h2>
<p>This is the first release that allows to create the media pack with pronounciation audio files and images. The media pack occupies 3.8 gigabytes.</p>
<p>Many parser bugs were fixed in this release, and there are many new user-facing changes.</p>

<p>Bug Fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the "stadiums" entry, where the error was caused by bad interpretation of "Template:plural of", which contained a link inside a link as a parameter in template call. Template argument parser improperly parsed [[[[link a]] link b]].</li>
<li>Paragraph parser now detects beginning of a table and closes the paragraph (entry "carr#Irish").</li>
<li>Table cell parser now recognizes links with parameters on first line of a cell (entry "carr#Irish", "Appendix:Variations of "a"").</li>
<li>Category processing now handles various links well. Entry "myslet" does not list "Category:Czech verbs" twice. The entry contains links [[Category:Czech verbs]] and [[Category: Czech verbs]].</li>
<li>Fixed parsing of lists: when a list item line is followed by a line that (after any number of whitespaces) contains a category link, that line with category link is considered as a part of list item (for example see definition list in "stadia"). This is not logical, but let's follow the Way of MediaWiki.</li>
</ul>

<p>New Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>New "Media Packer" tool packs all media files to a single file.</li>
<li>Optional visibility of sections such as Etymology, Translations, Inflections, and Anagrams.</li>
<li>Cherokee language supported in interwiki. Added another seven localized names for languages to interwiki support.</li>
<li>Copy text to clipboard, cut, paste works with Ctrl+C, Ctrl+X, Ctrl+V.</li>
<li>Page search (Ctrl+F). Design took from Firefox; it's the best way of text searching I know.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Wikt 0.14.0 was released on 8 May 2009</h2>
<p>Bug Fixes:</p>

</ul>

<li>Added interwiki name for Macedonian, "Македонски".</li>

</ul>

<h2>Wikt 0.13.0 was released on 2 May 2009</h2>
<p>This release brings no visible features or fixes, and thus it is still not ready to be used by common users. However, many new lines of code were written as a pedestal for upcoming features.</p>
<ul>
<li>Link node reworked to support new features (entry existence checking, conversion of outgoing links to external form)</li>
<li>Entry namespaces, languages, Wikimedia projects handled explicitly in code. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Wikt 0.11.0 was released on 22 April 2009</h2>

</ul>

<p>New Features:</p>
<ul>

<li>Wiki parser handles FONT tags. This tag is used in "a#Min Nan".</li>
</ul>

<h2>Wikt 0.10.0 was released on 21 April 2009</h2>
<p>This is the initial release of source code.</p>

<p>The project has been started in 2008-11. The first larger iteration was implemented in gtkmm, but all subsequent attempts to embed Gecko or WebKit into GTK failed. It was simply too much work to do. At the end the whole library was rewritten to Qt.</p>
