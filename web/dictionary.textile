Current releases are source code only, because uncompressed dictionary is very large (around 1 GB). If you are interested in the development, you are encouraged to create a personal dictionary:

* Download the enwiktionary-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2 file from http://download.wikimedia.org/enwiktionary/latest/.
* Unpack the XML file, change the .xml extension to .ei1.
* Compile and run Wikt. Select Development->Format1 to Format2 Converter... in the menu bar. Select the source .ei1 file and click Start.
* Run Development->Format2 to Format3 Converter... to the newly created .ei2 file. Wait for a long time.
* Done. Now you have the .ei3 dictionary. 

Wikt tries to open "data/enwiktionary-20090203-pages-articles.ei3", so update the dictionary name or modify src/Wiki/WikiSource.cpp.
