* Initial release of source code.
* Not ready to be used by common users.

The project has been started in 2008-11. The first larger iteration was implemented in gtkmm, but all subsequent attempts to embed Gecko or WebKit into GTK failed. It was simply too much work to do.

The core was created during 2009-03 and 2009-04, when I worked on it about 8 weeks full time (I was jobless).
