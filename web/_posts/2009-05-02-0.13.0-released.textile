This release brings no visible features or fixes, and thus it is still not ready to be used by common users. However, many new lines of code were written as a pedestal for upcoming features.

* Link node reworked to support new features (entry existence checking, conversion of outgoing links to external form)
* Entry namespaces, languages, Wikimedia projects handled explicitly in code.
