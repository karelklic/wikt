Wikt 0.17.0 is a development release. It is a work in progress -- definitely not suitable for end users.

h2. Bug Fixes
* Images in thumbnail style contain icon which now links to the image on wiktionary (external link). Affects a picture in the "dog" entry for example.
* Interwiki links are extracted from whole document, also from inside paragraphs etc. Removed the "interwiki paragraph" concept. Affects all entries.
* Parsing of table headers fixed. Affects a Danish inflection table in the "bud" entry.

h2. New Features 
* External links parsed properly, and open in external browser window when activated.
* Links to wikipedia such as [[w:IPA]] are converted to external links like [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/IPA IPA]. Clicking to the external link opens external browser.
* Gallery extension is properly handled and displayed. Affects entry "car".
* User hides translations to languages he is not interested in.
* Template:SERVER implemented. Affects "Category:English nouns".
* Template:localurl implemented. Affects "Category:English nouns".
* New languages added and language support reworked.
* Template:#ifexpr implemented. Affects "啊" entry.
* Template:#expr implemented support for multiplication, division, parenthesis, round, pow, mod, and comparison.
