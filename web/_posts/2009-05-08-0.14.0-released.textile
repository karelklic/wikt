Wikt 0.14.0 is a development release. It is a work in progress -- definitely not suitable for end users.

h2. Bug Fixes
* External links in wiki syntax are no longer converted to A tags.
* A crash in Format3Reader caused by looking for '￥' fixed. Analogous error in Format4Reader fixed too.
* Allowed nested tables (entry "-aseinen").
* Many methods and classes were documented by comments in source code.

h2. New Features 
* Links to missing entries are removed in format4 (only the link text remains).
* Added "Appendix" to supported namespaces.
* Added interwiki name for Macedonian, "Македонски".
* Conversion from F3 to F4 is faster, it takes minutes instead of hours.
* All format conversion dialogs remember file paths between application runs.
* Status bar displays links.
* Media downloader downloads all images and sounds used in a dictionary to local filesystem.
